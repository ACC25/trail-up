# Trail Up! The social hiking app

![alt text](https://github.com/MrAaronOlsen/trail-up/blob/readme/app/assets/images/readme_picture_landing.jpg)

Using the Hiking Project and Google APIs - Trail Up allows users to browse from thousands of trails across North America and create hiking events to connect with other outdoor enthusiasts. 

Using a largely JS front-end, the app shows detailed Google pins for hiking trails, allows for searching by address or city, gives Google directions to events/trails and allows users to sort their hiking commitments seamlessly. The app also has Fitbit 
integration to display the caloric, mileage and heartrate data for events users attend. 

The live version of the site can be found [here](https://trail-up.herokuapp.com).
